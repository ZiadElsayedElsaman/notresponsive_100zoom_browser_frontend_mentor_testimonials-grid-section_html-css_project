      <pre class="pre1">        I recieved a job offer mid-course,and the subjects i learned

        i honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

          to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
          here .i signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! i 
          enrolled shortly thereafter.the next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
          - time of my life. since completing the course,i've successfully switched 
          careers ,working as a software engineer at a VR startup. "

      <pre class="pre6">        "Before joining the bootcamp.i've
        never written a line of cood.i 
        needed some structure from Professionals
        who can help me learn programming step 
        by step.i was encouraged to enroll by 
        a former student of theirs who can only
        say wonderful things about the program.
        the entire curriculum and staff did not
        disappoint.they were very hands on and
        i never had to wait long for assistance.
        the agile team project. in particular, was 
        outstanding.it took my learning to the next
        level in a way that no tutorial could ever
        have.in fact,i've often referred to it 
        during interviews as an example of my 
        development experience. it certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stck
        developer after receiving multiple 
        offers.100  recommend."

        themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from 
        their experiences was easy.
